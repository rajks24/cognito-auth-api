This project is a Node.js-based custom authentication API built for integration with AWS Cognito. It’s designed to run on AWS Lambda, exposed via API Gateway, and follows the ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow — making it a powerful, serverless alternative to traditional backend authentication systems.

The API is fully CORS-enabled, uses environment variables for configuration, and is packaged to be easily deployed using the AWS Lambda zip upload method.

## ✨ Features

📝 **User Registration** – Sign up new users directly into a Cognito User Pool

✅ **User Verification** – Confirm user registration via email/phone verification codes

🔑 **User Login** – Authenticate users securely using the Admin-based authentication flow

👤 **User Info Retrieval** – Fetch user profile details using a valid access token

🚪 **User Logout** – Perform global sign-out to invalidate active sessions

---

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Cognito Setup**:

   - Create a Cognito User Pool.
   - Create an App Client with the following settings:
     - **Admin-based authentication flow** enabled.
     - **App Client Secret** enabled.
   - Note the following:
     - **User Pool ID**
     - **App Client ID**
     - **App Client Secret**

2. **Environment Variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

     ```plaintext
     AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
     COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
     COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID=your-app-client-id
     COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-app-client-secret
     PORT=3000
     CORS_ORIGIN=*
     ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cognito-auth-api.git
   cd cognito-auth-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash

```

3. Set up the `.env` file as described in the Prerequisites section.

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
node app.js

## Deploying to AWS Lambda

This project is designed to run as a serverless authentication API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, integrating with AWS Cognito.

Follow these steps to prepare and deploy the backend:

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install --production
```

This ensures only runtime dependencies are included in the Lambda package.

2. Set Environment Variables
   Before deploying, configure the following Lambda environment variables:

| Variable                    | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_REGION`                | Region of your Cognito User Pool          |
| `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`      | Cognito User Pool ID                      |
| `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID`     | Cognito App Client ID                     |
| `COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Cognito App Client Secret (if used)       |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`               | Allowed origin for frontend CORS requests |

These can be set in the Lambda Console or passed through deployment scripts.

3. Build the Deployment Package
   Zip the necessary files:

```bash
zip -r cognito-auth-api.zip . -x "*.git*" "node_modules/aws-sdk/*"
```

> AWS Lambda already includes the AWS SDK, so we exclude it from the zip to reduce size.

4. Create & Configure the Lambda Function

- Go to AWS Lambda Console
- Create a new function (Node.js 18.x)
- Set the handler to:

```plaintext
lambda-server.handler
```

- Upload your cognito-auth-api.zip
- Set your environment variables (as listed above)
- Assign an IAM role with permissions to interact with Cognito:

  - cognito-idp:SignUp
  - cognito-idp:AdminInitiateAuth
  - cognito-idp:ConfirmSignUp
  - cognito-idp:GetUser
  - cognito-idp:GlobalSignOut

5. Connect Lambda to API Gateway

- Create a HTTP API in API Gateway
- Add routes:

  - POST /auth/register → your Lambda
  - POST /auth/login → your Lambda
  - POST /auth/verify → your Lambda
  - GET /auth/userinfo → your Lambda
  - POST /auth/logout → your Lambda

- Deploy the API and test using Postman or curl

## Ready to Go!

Your authentication API is now live — serverless, secure, and scalable.
